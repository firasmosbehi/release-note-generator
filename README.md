# Automated Release Notes Generator

An action-first project that turns tagged releases into polished GitHub Releases. It parses pull request titles that follow Conventional Commits and builds categorized changelog bullets (Features, Fixes, Chores) automatically.

## Features (planned)
- Parse PR titles that follow Conventional Commits.
- Group entries into Features, Fixes, and Chores.
- Draft a GitHub Release when a tag is pushed.
- Configurable templates for release notes output.
- Dry-run mode for CI validation.

## Why
Writing release notes by hand is tedious and error-prone. This project automates the boring parts so teams can ship faster with consistent changelogs.
