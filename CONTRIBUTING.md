# Contributing Guide

Thanks for helping automate release notes! This guide keeps contributions consistent and fast.

## Development Flow
1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`.
3. Keep pull request titles in **Conventional Commits** format (e.g., `feat: add config validation`).
4. Add tests when adding or changing behavior.
5. Run formatting/linting tools before pushing (to be documented once tooling is added).
6. Open a PR and link it to the relevant issue/milestone.

## Commit & PR Style
- Use Conventional Commits for commits and PR titles.
- Keep PRs scoped; avoid mixing refactors with features or fixes.
- Include screenshots or logs when the change affects output formatting.
